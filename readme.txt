# Linear Regression with Gradient Descent

This project demonstrates linear regression using the gradient descent method. Two scenarios are explored:

1. **Profit Prediction** based on the number of customers per day.
2. **House Price Prediction** based on house size and the number of rooms.

## Scenario 1: Profit Prediction

- **Libraries Used:** `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`
- **Data:** The dataset consists of two columns: `Profit` (target) and `Customer Number per Day` (feature).

## Scenario 2: House Price Prediction

- **Libraries Used:** `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`
- **Data:** The dataset consists of three columns: `Price` (target), `House Size`, and `Room Number` (features).

## Metrics and Visuals

Metrics such as cost function values and Mean Squared Error (MSE) are illustrated by graphs included in the visuals, which are plotted during the execution of the script.

## How to Use

1. **Download the `.py` file** from this repository.
2. **Run the file** in your Python environment or **copy the code** into your own script.
